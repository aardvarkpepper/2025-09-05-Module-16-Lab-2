Task 2: Written Reflection
After reading the articles, answer the following questions in a clear and concise manner. Your total response should be between 300 and 500 words.

The Over-fetching Problem: In your own words, explain the concepts of “over-fetching” and “under-fetching” in the context of a REST API. How does GraphQL’s query language inherently solve this problem?

Endpoint and Schema Philosophy: Compare the endpoint structure of a typical REST API with that of a GraphQL API. How does GraphQL’s strongly-typed schema benefit frontend developers?

Caching and Complexity: Caching is often cited as a major advantage of REST. Explain why caching is simpler in REST compared to GraphQL. What is a use case where the flexibility of GraphQL might outweigh its caching complexity?
